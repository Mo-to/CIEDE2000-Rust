# CIEDE2000-Rust
A zero-dependency CIEDE2000 Rust implementation based on _Sharma, G., Wu, W., & Dalal, E. N. (2000).

## Disclaimer
This code was developed as part of a university project. However, the project concluded before I could thoroughly test the correctness of the implementation due to time constraints and other, more pressing responsibilities. As a result, the code has only undergone basic testing with a limited set of values, which was sufficient for the scope of the university project.
  
**Important**: Before using this code in a production environment or relying on the accuracy of its output in any way, I strongly recommend intensive testing against the reference values provided in the source mentioned above.
  
If you discover any bugs or issues during testing, please feel free to open an issue to report them in a proper format to reproduce the issue.
